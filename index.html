                    Copa America 2021
                </h1>
                <p>After 28 years of wait, Argentina finally has a trophy as it beat Brazil in the final of Copa America 2021 at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is Argentina's first title since 1993 and 15th Copa America title.Lionel Messi, who has won all with Barcelona was only missing a trophy with his national team. With today's win, that drought has come to an end.
                    It was a valiant effort by Brazil as it proved to be the better team in attack, but it couldn't break down the resolute Argentine defence.</p>
